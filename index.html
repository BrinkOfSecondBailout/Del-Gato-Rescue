                    <p class="description">Del Gato is a donation-based, foster-based cat rescue that emerged in early 2020 in response to the homeless cat crisis of Southern California. Del Gato works around the clock to provide a safe landing, veterinary care, and long-term plan for some of the 5 million homeless, feral, abandoned, sick, and injured community cats living on the streets of LA and Orange Counties.<br> <br>Your decision to adopt a cat from Del Gato allows more space for another cat in need to be brought inside and given the care that it deserves and the opportunity for a better life. We believe in TNR as the only solution to the ongoing prevention of cats suffering on the streets and more kittens being born outside into a life of tragedy.
                    Thank you for your support!</p>
