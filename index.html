                    <p class="description">Del Gato is a donation-based, foster-based cat rescue that emerged in early 2020 in response to the homeless cat crisis of Southern California. Del Gato works around the clock to provide a safe landing, veterinary care, and long-term plan for some of the 5 million homeless, feral, abandoned, sick, and injured community cats living on the streets of LA and Orange Counties.<br> <br>Your decision to adopt a cat from Del Gato allows more space for another cat in need to be brought inside and given the care that it deserves and the opportunity for a better life. We believe in TNR as the only solution to the ongoing prevention of cats suffering on the streets and more kittens being born outside into a life of tragedy.
                    Thank you for your support!</p>

                        <p>We strongly believe that no friendly cat should be returned to the streets; therefore we will work
                        diligently to find them a suitable home where they can live out the rest of their lives in comfort and happiness.<br><br> Our rescued cats undergo a thorough vetting process that includes vaccinations, spaying or neutering, and necessary
                        medical treatments to ensure their health and readiness for adoption. <br><br> Our adoption process prioritizes the welfare
                        of both the cat and the potential adopter. We understand the importance of finding a forever home where both the cat
                        and the owner will be happy and comfortable. Thus, we take the screening process very seriously and evaluate not
                        only the environment but also the connection between the cat and the potential adopter. Our goal is to find a
                        perfect match where the cat will be safe, healthy, and loved, and the owner will provide a nurturing and loving
                        home. <br><br>If you're interested in adopting a rescued cat, we invite you to contact us and learn more about our adoption
                        process.

                        <p>At Del Gato Rescue, we are proud to have a team of experienced and trained volunteers who are equipped to handle a variety of emergency situations that feral cats may face, including injuries, danger, natural disasters, abandonment, and abuse. <br><br>We collaborate closely with local veterinarians and animal hospitals to ensure that cats in emergency situations receive the best possible care. <br><br>Moreover, we are dedicated to rescuing cats from shelters to prevent economic euthanasia. We recognize that overcrowding in shelters can lead to difficult decisions regarding which animals to euthanize, and we believe that every animal deserves a chance at a happy and healthy life. Therefore, we work tirelessly to find homes for cats in need and to provide them with the care and support they need to thrive. <br><br>If you are aware of a feral cat in an emergency situation, please do not hesitate to contact us for assistance. We are always ready to provide help and support to feral cats in need.

                        <p>TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) is a humane and effective approach to managing feral cat
                            populations. It involves trapping the cats, spaying or neutering them, vaccinating them, treating them for fleas,
                            and then returning them to their original habitat. This method not only prevents the cats from breeding and
                            producing more litters but also reduces their territorial behavior and minimizes their impact on the environment. <br><br>At
                            Del Gato Rescue, we work closely with community members to educate them on the benefits of TNR and to provide them
                            with the necessary resources and support to implement TNR programs in their neighborhoods. <br><br>If you are interested in
                            requesting TNR services for a feral cat colony in your community, please fill out our request form. Our team at Del
                            Gato Rescue will get in touch with you as soon as possible to provide you with more information on how we can work
                            together to improve the lives of feral cats in your area.
