Del Gato is a non-profit cat rescue operation ran by two kind-hearted individuals that dedicates their time and resources outside of full time jobs to save animals. They reached out to me and asked for help building a website since their original one was very outdated. I was absolutely ecstatic to help them. I built this project from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js. Very proud of the work that Del Gato Rescue is doing and I am humbled to be able to assist in their mission.
